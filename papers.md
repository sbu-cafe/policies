# Publication Policy

_this is a work in progress_

1. All papers will be announced in our group's paper repo by raising
   an issue (https://github.com/sbu-cafe/papers) and asking if anyone
   feels that they've contributed to the work to post there or contact
   the lead author.

   We strive to be inclusive in authorship -- if someone feels that they
   contributed to a project they should be considered for authorship
   and be given the opportunity to contribute to the writing.

2. Each of our codes should have a policy describing how to merit
   "builder" status, which would earn you a place on any general
   code papers.

3. All code needed to reproduce the simulations presented should be in
   our github repos.  Any output files / metadata should be placed in
   a Zenodo repo with a DOI and cited as part of the paper if
   feasible.

4. All software / libraries used should be explicitly cited.
